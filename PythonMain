# env = gym.make('YourEnvHere')
# agent = ReinforcementLearningAgent(env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n)
# agent.train(env, 1000)
```

//This code provides the core logic for the proposed algorithm. For a complete implementation, you would need to integrate it with a specific environment (like one from OpenAI's Gym) and potentially fine-tune the parameters (`alpha`, `gamma`, `beta`) and the environment-specific aspects.
