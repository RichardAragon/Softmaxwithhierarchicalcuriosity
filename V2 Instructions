Initialize: Define multiple Q-tables for different objectives, initialize a state-visit count table, and set initial values for dynamic learning rate and other parameters.

At each time step:
a. Observe the current state 
�
s.
b. Adjust learning rate based on performance.
c. Select a high-level action based on hierarchical action space and break it down into executable actions.
d. Use a probabilistic action selection mechanism that accounts for uncertainty in Q-values.
e. Execute action 
�
a and observe the resulting state 
�
′
s 
′
  and reward 
�
r.
f. Update Q-values for each objective.
g. Calculate the TD error and update the curiosity bonus.
h. Update the state-visit count.
i. Use memory mechanism to influence the next action selection.

Repeat steps 2a-2i until the termination criterion is met.
